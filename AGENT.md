# Repository Agent Overview

This repository is a comprehensive collection of demonstration projects and tutorials focused on advanced AI agent development, large language models (LLMs), and their integration with diverse frameworks and platforms. It showcases applications ranging from real-time multimodal assistants to interactive web user interfaces for complex agentic workflows.

## Key Technologies & Frameworks
*   **AI Agents & LLMs:** AutoGen, CrewAI, Llama (3.2, 3.3), Gemini (Live API, 2.0 Multimodal), ADK (Agent Developer Kit), OpenRouter, Mixtral, Instructor.
*   **Web & UI:** Panel, Streamlit, Taipy, Mesop, React.
*   **Real-time/Multimodal:** LiveKit, Gemini Live API, Playwright, audio/video processing.
*   **Cloud & Deployment:** Firebase, Google Cloud Platform, Docker.
*   **Programming:** Python (dominant), Jupyter Notebooks.

## Main Features
*   Development of real-time, proactive, and voice-enabled AI agents.
*   Integration of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for knowledge grounding.
*   Creation of interactive web UIs for multi-agent systems.
*   Building multimodal applications (voice, video, image, text).
*   Deployment of serverless and local AI solutions.
*   LLM fine-tuning for specialized reasoning.
*   AI-powered Chrome extension development.

## Architectural Patterns
*   **Multi-Agent Systems:** Emphasizing collaboration and orchestration between various AI agents.
*   **Real-time Streaming:** Architectures designed for continuous data processing and immediate responses.
*   **Client-Server:** Standard patterns for web and mobile application deployment.
*   **Modular Design:** Projects are structured as independent modules, each addressing a specific use case or technology.
*   **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Enhancing LLM responses with external data sources.
*   **Event-Driven:** Implied by the real-time nature, with agents reacting to streams of events.
